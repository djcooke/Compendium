abilities:
  - name: Ice Spikes
    potency: n/a
    description: 'Grants counterattack (potency 200, 5s) to self; can be
    interrupted. Recommended to interrupt or disengage immediately. The damage
    can kill you very quickly'
  - name: Void Blizzard
    potency: 130
    description: 'Inflicts slow (20s); can be interrupted. It only has medium
    range, so you can also run away to avoid it'
notes:
  - 'Disengaging during Ice Spikes and running away to avoid Void Blizzard is
    probably the safest option as you avoid all damage'
  - 'Some people prefer to disengage during Ice Spikes and stun/interrupt Void
    Blizzard. Make sure to disengage again quickly, but you will probably still
    get one auto-attack in and take Ice Spikes damage.'
  - 'Can be slowed if transfigured via Pomander of Witching'

    notes:
      - 'Annoying to fight, so avoid if possible. Not too bad if you''re smart
        about it though'
      - 'Heat Blast recast is not affected by slow, so another option is to
        interrupt Ice Spikes and Hypercharge/Heat Blast away while slowed by
        Void Blizzard'
      - 'Make sure to keep sustaining pots up as kiting won''t help to mitigate
        damage'
