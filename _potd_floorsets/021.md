Watch out for minotaur patrols' untelegraphed AoE. There is also a known
[wall trap](/wall_traps.html#potd-21-29).

Starting from this set, all enchantments can appear and floors can have up to
3 enchantments.

Pomanders of resolution and raising do not drop at all on this set. Affluence,
flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 29.
