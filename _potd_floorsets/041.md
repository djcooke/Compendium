Mimics on this set and beyond are immune to stun, and found in gold chests.
There is a known [wall trap](/wall_traps.html#potd-31-49) that you can avoid.

Pomanders of alteration, resolution, and raising do not drop at all on this
set. Affluence and flight do not drop on floor 49.

Beating this set unlocks the option to start new files at floor 51.
