Floors 1-6 floors have exactly 2 enemies per room, and no mimics. There is 1
known [wall trap](/wall_traps.html#potd-1-9).

If solo, you probably want to full clear this set for exp. Watch out for
hornets' Final Sting.

Pomanders of serenity, alteration, rage, purity, resolution, and raising do not
drop at all on this set. Affluence and flight do not drop on floor 9.
